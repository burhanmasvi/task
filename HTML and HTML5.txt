
HTML AND HTML5 assignment

1)Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

 Elements are not tags. The element is one thing, and the tag (be it start or end tag) is another. 
 The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
 <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

 The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
 It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

 Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:
 The <body> element defines the document's body.
 It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

 The <h1> element defines a heading.
 It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>

2)What are tags and attributes in HTML?
 Tags are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the markup. (...) The start and end tags of certain  normal elements can be omitted, (...)
 The contents of the element must be placed between just after the start tag (which might be implied, in  certain cases) and just before the end tag (which again,  might be implied, in certain cases).

 HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML  attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An  attribute either modifies the default functionality of  an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them.   In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
 <element attribute="value">element content</element>

3)What are void elements in HTML?
 There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it,  these elements are called void elements. Void elements  doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes  but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that   is completely optional. Example of such elements are <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <base>, <meta>,  <param>, <area>, <embed>, <col>, <track>, <source> etc.

 Characteristics:

 Void elements do not have end tags.

4)Canvas and SVG tags?

 SVG: Vector based (composed of shapes)
 SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.
 SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.
 SVG can be modified through script and CSS.

 Cnavas:Raster based (composed of pixel)
 Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
 Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
 Canvas can be modified through script only.
